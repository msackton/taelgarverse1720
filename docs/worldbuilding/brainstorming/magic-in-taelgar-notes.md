|
|1|The backlash overwhelms your mind. You act as if under the effects of the Confusion spell for the next minute. At the end of each of your turns, you can make a Wisdom saving throw with a DC equal to 11 + level of the spell that triggered the backlash. On a success, the confusion effect ends.|
|2|Magical energies overwhelm you, and you are stunned until the end of your next turn.|
|3|The energy of the spell is misdirected. If the spell involves attack rolls, they are made with disadvantage; if the spell involves saving throws, they are made with advantage. If the spell involves neither, roll again on this table ignoring this effect.|
|4|Magical static interferes with your spellcasting. For the next hour, any time you attempt to cast a spell, you must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the spell fails and the spell slot is wasted.|
|5|The energies of the Plane of Magic strike against you. You take 2d6 force damage per level of the spell that caused the backlash, or 1d6 force damage if the spell was a cantrip.|
|6|The ley line consumes some of your magical energy. You lose one spell slot, which is the highest level you have available but not higher than 5th level, or the level of the spell that was cast plus 1, whichever is lower.|
|7|The backlash interferes with your magical items. All charged items in your possession lose 1d4 charges.|
|8|The ley line energies distorts your casting. The spell you intended to cast fails. Instead, you produce an effect from the wand of wonder or the wild magic surge tables, at the discretion of the DM.|
|9|The energy of the ley line overwhelms your casting, and the spell produces only a harmless display of bright color and loud noise.|
|10|A ley elemental spirit emerges from the node. This creature is chaotic and uncontrolled, and generally hostile to any arcane spellcaster.|

Minor Node Table

Roll on this table to increase the power of a spell when you tap a minor node while casting. If the effect rolled would have no effect, you may choose to reroll on this table, or select effect #1.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|1|The ley energies give you a protection. You gain temporary hit points equal to 1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier.|
|2|The ley line bolsters the energy of the spell. Treat it as cast with a spell slot one level higher than you used.|
|3|The magical energies of the ley line heal you. You regain hit points equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.|
|4|Magical energies shield you temporarily. You gain +2 to AC until the start of your next turn.|
|5|If your spell involves rolling dice, you may reroll a number up to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of 1).|
|6|If your spell deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, you can change the damage to one of the other listed types.|
|7|If the spell you cast involves one or more attack rolls, one attack roll of your choice is made with advantage.|
|8|If your spell affects multiple creatures, and forces them to make a saving throw, you may choose one target, who must make the saving throw with disadvantage.|
|9|If your spell does damage to a target, all creatures damaged by your spell must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or and knocked prone.|
|10|You regain one 1st level spell slot.|

Major Node Table

Roll on this table to increase the power of a spell when you tap a major node while casting. If the effect rolled would have no effect, you may choose to reroll on this table, or select effect #1.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|1|The ley energies give you a protection. You gain temporary hit points equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier + twice the level of spell cast.|
|2|The ley line bolsters the energy of the spell. Treat it as cast with a spell slot two levels higher than you used.|
|3|The magical energies of the ley line heal you. You regain 1d4 hit points per level of the spell you cast, plus your spellcasting ability modifier.|
|4|Magical energies shield you temporarily. You gain +5 to AC until the end of your next turn.|
|5|If your spell involves rolling dice, you may choose up to two die rolls and replace them with the maximum value of the die.|
|6|If your spell deals damage, it ignores resistance, and creatures that are immune take half damage instead of no damage.|
|7|Magical energies swirl around you. You gain inspiration, which can be used to get advantage on one roll of your choice. This inspiration is lost once you use it, and otherwise lasts until you complete a long rest.|
|8|If your spell forces one or more targets to make a saving throw, that saving throw is made with disadvantage.|
|9|If your spell does damage to one or more target, all creatures damaged by your spell must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be pushed 10 feet away from you, and knocked prone. Its speed is also reduced to 0 for the next minute. At the start of each of its turns, it can make a Constitution saving throw (against your spell save DC), ending the effect on success.|
|10|You regain one spell slot of your choice, which cannot be higher than level 3 or the level of the spell that was cast, whichever is lower.|

  

### Primal Presence

The magical resonances of the echo realms and their reflections in Taelgar is the ultimate source of magical power for druids, rangers, and some warlocks and sorcerers. These casters draw on the energy of the world itself, the magic that is reflected from Taelgar into the Feywild, the Shadowfell, and the other echo realms. 

Like ley lines, there are thin spots in the world where one or more echo realms are closer to Taelgar, where the boundary between places is more tenuous. These often function as portals between worlds, but can also affect magic that draws power from the echo realms in ways that are similar, albeit more unpredictable, to the way that ley lines affect the magic of the Plane of Magic.

### Chalyte

- Magical gemstone, possibly relic of Age of Creation, and/or formed from ore and other geological processes that interact with ley lines
    
- Can fuel spell effects, particularly arcane magic, and power magic items
    
- Addictive to use and chalyte users often come to slowly rely on it
    
- If used frequently can cause long term problems
    
- Often used to power and charge magic items as a safer alternative
    

## Racial Magic 

The Elder races have unique access to special racial magic, via their connections to the Embodied Gods that created them. 

  

- Elves -> 'true magic', everyday cantrips + powerful rituals
    
- Stoneborn -> modify self
    
- Lizardfolk -> commune with spirits, prophecy
    
- Dwarves -> rune magic
    
- Halflings -> telepathy
