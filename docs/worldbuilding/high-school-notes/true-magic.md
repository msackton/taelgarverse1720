Other modifiers: 

+1 per 3 points of fatigue used 

+1 per quadrupling of time needed (base time 1 second); max. +4 

-1 per weave being maintained at the time 

-1 for instantaneous casting (base time 1 second) 

Weave Strength:  Once a weave is created, its strength must be determined.  The strength of a weave is equal to Raw Power of the weave’s creator + the amount the roll to create the weave was made by + the amount of fatigue spent specifically for this purpose.  Fatigue used to increase skill does not count for weave strength.  If a weave is “tied-off,” its strength is reduced by 1/3, and it loses strength at a rate of one point per day.
