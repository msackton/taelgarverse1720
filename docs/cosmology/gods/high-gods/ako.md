# Ako

In the [Kestavo](<../../religions/kestavo/kestavo.md>) tradition, one [creator god](<./high-gods.md>) is acknowledged, called Ako. The small gods, the [Kestavo](<../../religions/kestavo/kestavo.md>), carry the prayers of their communities to Ako, who grants blessings. It is from Ako that the power of the kestavo flow to their worshippers.
