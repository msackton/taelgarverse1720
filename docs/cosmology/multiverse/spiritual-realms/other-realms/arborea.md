-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A plane in the [Spiritual Realms](<../spiritual-realms.md>)  
</div>


Arborea is the plane of wildness, nature, and beasts, a place where the beauty of vast untouched landscapes coexists with the terror of the hunt and the chaotic energy of overgrown jungles. It is an ancient realm among the [Outer Realms](<../../outer-realms.md>), not associated with any particular divinity.
