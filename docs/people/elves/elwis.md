Elwis is a female elf and painter from Orenlas. She is spending her wandering years traveling around the Green Sea, trying to make new art that hasn't been dreamed before in the history of her people. 
 
She has recently come to Tollen, fascinated by the magical inks of the Dyer's Guild and seeking to use them in painting.
