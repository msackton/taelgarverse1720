Elwis is a female elf and painter from [Orenlas](<../../gazetteer/istaros-watershed/orenlas/orenlas.md>). 


She is spending her wandering years traveling around the [Green Sea](<../../gazetteer/green-sea.md>), trying to make new art that hasn't been dreamed before in the history of her people. She has recently come to [Tollen](<../../gazetteer/western-green-sea/tollen/tollen.md>), fascinated by the magical inks of the Dyer's Guild and seeking to use them in painting.
