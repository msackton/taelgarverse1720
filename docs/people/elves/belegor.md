Belegor is a solitary [elf](<../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/elves/elves.md>) wanderer, who has travelled across the forests of the western region of Taelgar for many years, not wanting hide in isolation as many of his generation chose after The Great War. 
## Overview

Belegor is an [elf](<../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/elves/elves.md>) of the 36th ka, the generation that came of age during the Great War. He chose to wander in his later years, after fathering children, and is driven by a sense of wanderlust but also melancholy for what was lost. 
## Description

Belegor is a tall, ageless [elf](<../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/elves/elves.md>), with medium length copper hair, pale skin, and green eyes. He wears elegant clothes in greens and yellows, with high collar and long, wide sleeves. Graceful.

- (DR:: 1748-07). Belegor fled from [Grimbaskal](<../other-nonhumans/mezzar.md>), realizing his deception.

- (DR:: 1748-09-11). Belegor and the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) meet in the hidden [Te'kula](<../../groups/deno-qai/te-kula.md>) village.
