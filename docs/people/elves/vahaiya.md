Vahaiya is a warrior, traveler, adventurer, and now artist and collector. After surviving the Great War, fighting alongside the Sembaran Army in the Battle of Urlich Pass, they traveled extensively around Addermarch, the Aurbez Plateau, Maseau, and other Sembaran borderlands. They made a name for themselves in the hobgoblin wars, but growing tiring of fighting after many years, decided to settle in Erelion.
