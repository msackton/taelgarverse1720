- :octicons-info-24:{ .lg .middle } __Biographical Information__

    A [Maseaun](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/duchy-of-maseau/duchy-of-maseau.md>) [human](<../../species/humans/humans.md>) (he/him)  
    Born March 15th, 1705 (14 years old)  
    { .bio }

    Originally from: [Evis](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/duchy-of-maseau/evis.md>), the [Duchy of Maseau](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/duchy-of-maseau/duchy-of-maseau.md>)
    Based in [Cleenseau](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/cleenseau.md>), the [Manor of Cleenseau](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/manor-of-cleenseau.md>), the [Barony of Aveil](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/barony-of-aveil.md>)

:octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } Met by the [Heroes of Cleenseau](<../pcs/cleenseau/heroes-of-cleenseau.md>) on December 4th, 1719 in [Wakog's Camp](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/duchy-of-maseau/wakog-s-camp.md>), the [Duchy of Maseau](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/duchy-of-maseau/duchy-of-maseau.md>)  


![Balthazar](../../assets/balthazar.png){align="right"; width="320"}He possesses a bright intellect but appears malnourished, bearing the marks of recent captivity by orcs. He is often shy, and seems to prefer to avoid crowds or a lot of people, but is keenly interested in learning and gaining knowledge. He is somewhat prideful, and hates to be given answers, and is often quite reluctant to accept help. He currently lives in Underhill with a number of other refugees from [Wakog's Camp](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/duchy-of-maseau/wakog-s-camp.md>), and has mostly been eking out a living on charity. 


He recently acquired an odd egg from [Viepuck's](<../pcs/cleenseau/viepuck.md>) patron and has become somewhat obsessive about tending it, although he will speak to no one other than the [Heroes of Cleenseau](<../pcs/cleenseau/heroes-of-cleenseau.md>) about what he is doing with it. Even to them, he is cagy, and he seems to see it as a puzzle he needs to solve on his own.

Since [Pyravela](<../../time/holidays-and-festivals/pyravela.md>) he has spent a lot of time on Char Street begging various food merchants for spoiled and otherwise discarded food. He seems to be looking for something, but he won't tell anyone, even [Viepuck](<../pcs/cleenseau/viepuck.md>), what it is. That said, he is always happy to run errands or otherwise help out, especially for a coin or two. He seems to be pretty good at slipping through crowds,Â and is extremely bright, if somewhat weak and still more sickly and frail than he really should be.
