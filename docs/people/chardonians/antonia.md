![Antonia Portrait](../../assets/antonia-portrait.png){align="right"; width="320"}A lanky, red-haired Chardonian woman, wearing a probably-magical heavy suit of plate armor that seems perfectly molded to fit her body. 


Seemed to have mixed feelings about Kadmos actions to charm the party in [Session 44 (DuFr)](<../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier/session-notes/session-44-dufr.md>), and was not involved in the battle in [Session 45 (DuFr)](<../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier/session-notes/session-45-dufr.md>). 

As far as you know, still traveling with Kadmos.
