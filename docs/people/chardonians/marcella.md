A nondescript Chardonian woman, short brown hair and a plain face. An archer, skilled with a bow, wears well-tended leather armor under a traveling cloak. 

Traveled uneasily with [Kadmos](<./kadmos.md>), Hektor, Casian, and [Antonia](<./antonia.md>). 

Felt forced to try to steal from party in Session 44 (DuFr), but when given the push by [Wellby](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/wellby.md>) to flee for herself at the end of battle figures out how to make her escape. Disappears when [Kadmos](<./kadmos.md>) and company are fighting kobolds in the [Myraeni Gap](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/myraeni-gap.md>), heading for the Stoneborn and then Sembara.
