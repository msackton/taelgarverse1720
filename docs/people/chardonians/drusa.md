- :octicons-info-24:{ .lg .middle } __Biographical Information__

    A [Chardonian](<../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/chardonian-empire.md>) [human](<../../species/children-of-divine-creation/humans/humans.md>) (she/her)  
    Born DR 1711 (9 years old)  
    { .bio }

    Based in [Chardon](<../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/chardon/chardon.md>), the [Chardonian Empire](<../../gazetteer/west-coast/chardonian-empire/chardonian-empire.md>)
</div>




A Chardonian wizard on loan to the Dunmari army of [Nayan Karnas](<../dunmari/nayan-karnas.md>), commanded by [Illyan](<../dunmari/illyan.md>), in [Tokra](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>). 

Does not particularly like the party given their attempt to scry on [Illyan](<../dunmari/illyan.md>), which Drusa detected, and their refusal to agree to simple magic protocols.
