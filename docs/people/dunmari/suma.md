>> 

The priestess of the temple of [Five Siblings](<../../cosmology/religions/five-siblings/five-siblings.md>) in [Karawa](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/karawa.md>), a small institution often overshadowed by the [Temple of Shakun](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/temple-of-shakun.md>), but nonetheless an important focus of civic life and civil administration for the Karawa region. 

Suma is a middle aged woman with dark, curly hair and soft, friendly features. She is a kind, generous person, welcoming of all, and genuinely interested in people, travelers and locals alike. Although a servant of all [Five Siblings](<../../cosmology/religions/five-siblings/five-siblings.md>), she is particularly connected to [Jeevali](<../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari/jeevali.md>) and deeply appreciates the [Festival of Rebirth](<../../time/holidays-and-festivals/dunmari-festivals/festival-of-rebirth.md>).
