Oduk is a demon created with the ability to corrupt animals into gnolls. 




He was summoned into the material plane, in the abandoned Dunmari stronghold of [Raven's Hold](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/raven-s-hold.md>), in the spring of 1748, where he was charged by his summoner to spawn as many gnoll warbands as possible and release them into the Dunmari frontier. He was banished back to the Abyss by the [Dunmar Fellowship](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) in April, 1748 DR.
