Garret Tealeaf grew up traveling the roads of Dunmar with the Tealeaf trading family, eventually becoming the patriarch of a group of 5 well-armed and defended caravans that regularly made the circuit from Chardon, east to [Songara](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/songara.md>), Tokra, and Karawa, before turning south across the Yuvanti Mountains to Nayahar, and then north along the coast to Darba, and back to Chardon.
