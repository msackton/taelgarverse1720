>>  Seen by the [Heroes of Cleenseau](<../pcs/cleenseau/heroes-of-cleenseau.md>) on January 4th, 1720 in [Cleenseau](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/cleenseau.md>), the [Barony of Aveil](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/barony-of-aveil.md>), [Sembara](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>) 

A halfling child, he is the errand boy of [The Crossroads Inn](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/the-crossroads-inn.md>) in [Cleenseau](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/cleenseau.md>). His older brothers liked to scare him with stories of ghosts and worse in the basement of the Crossroads Inn. 


He was very charmed by [Celyn](<../pcs/cleenseau/celyn.md>) and showed him a secret passageway in the basement. Likely to be responsive to further inquires from [Celyn](<../pcs/cleenseau/celyn.md>) in particular.
