![Safri](../../assets/safri.png){align="right"; width="320"}An old Deno'qai druid with many stories and rumors to her name. Many claim to have met her, but most speak of her in animal form, a deer that acts unusually intelligent and leads a lost traveler back to a path, or a hawk that drops a brace of rabbits on the camp of a hungry family who have had bad luck with the hunt.
