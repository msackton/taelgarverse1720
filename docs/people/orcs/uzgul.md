    An [orc](<../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/orcs/orcs.md>) (he/him)

    { .bio }

</div>



A young man of 14, current heir to the kingdom. The family resemblance to [Lubash](<./lubash.md>) is apparent, but Uzgul is full of the vigor of youth, with a mohawk of wiry black hair, a dangling silver earring on a chain in one ear, and vibrant green skin. He has a nervous excitement to him, and has a hard time sitting still.
