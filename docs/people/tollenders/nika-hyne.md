![Nika Hyne](../../assets/nika-hyne.png){align="right"; width="320"} Nika Hyne, is a sly young woman in her early twenties known to frequent The Windward Sail, listening to stories and doing odd jobs for coin. She was a student at the [University of Tollen](<../../gazetteer/western-green-sea/tollen/university-of-tollen.md>): although she dropped out, she knows the area and the people well. She is a bit of a hustler.
