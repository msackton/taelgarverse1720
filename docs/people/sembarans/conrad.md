    Born DR 1699 (21 years old)  
    { .bio }

    Based in [Cleenseau](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/cleenseau.md>), the [Manor of Cleenseau](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/manor-of-cleenseau.md>), the [Barony of Aveil](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/barony-of-aveil.md>)

:octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } Met by [Viepuck](<../pcs/cleenseau/viepuck.md>) on October 23th, 1719 in [Cleenseau](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/cleenseau.md>), the [Manor of Cleenseau](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/manor-of-cleenseau.md>), the [Barony of Aveil](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/barony-of-aveil.md>)  


![Conrard Cleenseau](../../assets/conrard-cleenseau.png){align="right"; width="320"}[Anselm's](<./anselm.md>) assistant at the Temple of the Warlord. A young, rather shy man, who looks up to Anselm but has become fascinated by the [Heroes of Cleenseau](<../pcs/cleenseau/heroes-of-cleenseau.md>). He is the main organizer of the temple's charity, and knows the people of Beggar's Way relatively well. 


He was one of the few people in [Cleenseau](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/cleenseau.md>) who was sad to learn of [Nicholas the Beggar's](<./nicholas-the-beggar.md>) death.

Since the [Heroes of Cleenseau](<../pcs/cleenseau/heroes-of-cleenseau.md>) arrived in town, he has become somewhat of a confidant of [Viepuck](<../pcs/cleenseau/viepuck.md>). He often stops by [Essford Manor](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/essford-manor.md>) in the mornings to chat with [Viepuck](<../pcs/cleenseau/viepuck.md>) and is a good source of information about [Anselm](<./anselm.md>) in particular. Conrad admires [Anselm](<./anselm.md>) for his strength and position, but as he has grown closer to [Viepuck](<../pcs/cleenseau/viepuck.md>) has shared some tidbits: Anselm's disinterest in charity, a story of how he has tried to use various festivals to glorify himself as much as the Warlord, his desire for a better position - perhaps even lord, of one of the other manors, if not [Essford Manor](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/essford-manor.md>).
