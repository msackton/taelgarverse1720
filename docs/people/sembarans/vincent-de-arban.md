# Vincent de Arban
>[!info]+ Biographical Info  
> A [Sembaran](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara.md>) [human](<../../species/humans/humans.md>) (he/him), of the Garay Family

>>  Met by the [Heroes of Cleenseau](<../pcs/cleenseau/heroes-of-cleenseau.md>) on November 7th, 1719 in [Cleenseau](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/cleenseau.md>), the [Manor of Cleenseau](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/manor-of-cleenseau.md>), the [Barony of Aveil](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/barony-of-aveil.md>) 

Vincent de Arban is an agent of [Susanne Garay](<./susanne-garay.md>). He visited [Cleenseau](<../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/cleenseau.md>) to investigate [Viepuck](<../pcs/cleenseau/viepuck.md>) (when he was masquerading as [Najeer Garay](<../pcs/cleenseau/viepuck.md>)). 

He was extremely interested in Viepuck's spider silk scheme, and may return to see how it is faring.
