One of the Hardstone dwarves, who help maintain the [Tokra](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/tokra.md>) [Archives](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/archives.md>). Dag was caught by werewolves when the [Archives](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/central-dunmar/tokra/archives.md>) were raided, and wounded, becoming cursed by lycanthropy. 

Cured by [Delwath](<../pcs/dunmar-fellowship/delwath.md>), via the blessing of [Yezali](<../../cosmology/gods/tanshi/meswati/yezali.md>).
