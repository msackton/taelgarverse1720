A dwarven scholar, who lived and died before the [Great War](<../../events/1500s/great-war.md>), and was fascinated with lost runic magic. Rumors and tales say he traveled the [Feywild](<../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/feywild/feywild.md>), and to many other exotic places, seeking to understand how to create runic magic that would permanently change the essence of things.
