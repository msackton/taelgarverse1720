    A [dwarf](<../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/dwarves/dwarves.md>) (he/him)  
    { .bio }

    Based in [Bleakhold](<../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/shadowfolds/bleakhold.md>), [Morkalan](<../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/shadowfolds/morkalan.md>), the [Shadowfolds](<../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/shadowfolds/shadowfolds.md>)
</div>


A young dwarf, living in [Bleakhold](<../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/shadowfolds/bleakhold.md>) but hoping for something better and wondering about the lives of dwarves outside [Morkalan](<../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/shadowfolds/morkalan.md>), even before he knew such dwarves existed.
