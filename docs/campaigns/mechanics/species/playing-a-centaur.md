title: Playing a Centaur
---

[Centaurs](<../../../species/children-of-the-divine/centaurs/centaurs.md>) in Taelgar are descended from the archfey, but have made their home on the world of Taelgar. Many centaurs see themselves as protectors and guardians of the world, and centaur societies tend to be nomadic, rarely staying in one place for more than a year. 

To create your centaur character, consider your relationship to your people, and society. Did you come from a typical centaur society, a wandering group of migratory folk? If so, what prompted you to leave and go adventuring? How do you feel about other species? Do you adopt the typical distaste for permanent construction of your people, or do you have different attitudes?
# Centaur Traits
**Creature Type:** Fey
**Size**: Medium (typically between 6-7 feet tall)
**Speed**:40 feet

As a centaur, you have the following traits:

_**Charge.**_ If you move at least 30 feet straight toward a target and then hit it with a melee weapon attack on the same turn, you can immediately follow that attack with a bonus action, making one attack against the target with your hooves.

_**Equine Build.**_ You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push or drag.

In addition, any climb that requires hands and feet is especially difficult for you because of your equine legs. When you make such a climb, each foot of movement costs you 4 extra feet instead of the normal 1 extra foot.

_**Hooves.**_ You have hooves that you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with them, the strike deals **1d6** + your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

_**Natural Affinity.**_ Your fey connection to nature gives you an intuitive connection to the natural world and the animals within it. You therefore have proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: [Animal Handling](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#AnimalHandling), [Medicine](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Medicine), [Nature](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Nature), or [Survival](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Survival).
# Lifespan
Centaurs have lifespans that are similar to humans. Centaur young are born able to walk and survive independently, but otherwise mature at the same rate as humans.
