# Letter from [Rosalind](<../../../people/sembarans/rosalind-essford.md>) to the [Heroes of Cleenseau](<../../../people/pcs/cleenseau/heroes-of-cleenseau.md>)
_Received January 8th, in [Cleenseau](<../../../gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/cleenseau-region/cleenseau/cleenseau.md>)_

Friends:

I write to you in haste from Rinburg, which we have left as quickly as we have arrived. We have encountered no problems on the road, but Eremon has had an uneasy feeling for days now and says the Night Queen is urging us to speed beyond Fellburn. I saddened to be reminded of the flood from this past fall as we rode by some flooded and abandoned villages east of Beury.

I hope all is well is at home. If Eremon will let us, we plan to stop for several days in Wisford to visit with the Duke, Jacques Bellemont. His father fought with my grandfather in the hobgoblin wars, and he is an astute political observer. Letters to him will reach me, either in Wisford or Embry.

We are boarding a riverboat for Fellburn, and hope to be there and gone by tomorrow evening.

Yours in peace,
Lady Rosalind Essford
January the 6th, in the 7th year of Robert I's reign

There is a postscript in a different hand:

The Night Queen's warnings resonate in my head. Something unnatural is coming to Fellburn.
