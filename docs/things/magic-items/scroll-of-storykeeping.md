# Scroll of Storykeeping
:octicons-info-24:{ .lg .middle } **[Dunmari](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>) Magical Scroll**  

These magical scrolls, produced by the [Mystai of Bhishma](<../../groups/dunmari-mystery-cults/order-of-the-awakened-soul.md>), can be used by trained scribes of the order to preserve and record the tales of someone's life -- the story of what makes them themselves, the journey of their lives. 

With the proper rituals, these stories can be transferred from these scrolls to live indefinitely in places such as the [Hall of Stories](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/dunmari-basin/hall-of-stories.md>). 


[Kenzo](<../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) has recorded 9 stories with these scrolls:
- Kirian's Story
- Amar's Story
- Justan's Story
- Treeâ€™s story
- Caulaus' Story
- Jorundr's Story
- Nameless Chardonian Warrior's Story
- Cecilia Lister's Story
- Iskra's Story
