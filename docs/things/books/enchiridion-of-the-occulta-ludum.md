# The Enchiridion of the Occulta Ludum
:octicons-info-24:{ .lg .middle } **[Drankorian](<../../history/drankorian-era/drankorian-empire.md>) Magical Book**  

The Enchiridion of the Occulta Ludum appears to be a blank handbook of the Occulta Ludum, a Drankorian secret society. These books radiate faint illusion magic, and were clearly produced using magical means.
