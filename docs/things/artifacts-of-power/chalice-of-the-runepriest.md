# The Chalice of the Runepriest
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
- :octicons-info-24:{ .lg .middle } __Unique Chalice__  
   Created in DR 1547 by the [Bahrazel](<../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/bahrazel.md>) (202 years ago)  
</div>

:octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } Currently in [Tharn Todor](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/nardith/tharn-todor.md>), [Nardith](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/nardith/nardith.md>), the [Yuvanti Mountains](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/yuvanti-mountains.md>)


A elaborate rune-carved chalice of ambiguous origin, revered as a sacred national treasure by the dwarves of Nardith. It is rumored to have many powers, including the power to heal all wounds and illness and the power to magically provide food, water, and shelter to all who need it. 

It was found when the [Dwarves](<../../species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/dwarves/dwarves.md>) fleeing the destruction of the kingdom of Ardith at the end of the Great War reached the [Yuvanti Mountains](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/yuvanti-mountains.md>), located in a chamber already carved and prepared deep beneath the ground, reminiscent of [Heart of the Mountain](<../../cosmology/multiverse/spiritual-realms/divine-realms/heart-of-the-mountain.md>). When it was first found, it flowed with salt water (some say, the tears of the [Bahrazel](<../../cosmology/gods/embodied-gods/bahrazel.md>); others a memory of the ocean that once covered the land). This became the site where [Tharn Todor](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/nardith/tharn-todor.md>) was constructed.

## History of the Chalice
- (DR:: 1547): The Chalice of the Runepriest is discovered by dwarven refugees from Ardith, while exploring the newly risen Yuvanti Mountains. 
- (DR:: 1575-03): The Chalice of the Runepriest is carried north by an expedition under the leadership of Hagrim Firebrand to search for survivors among the ruins of Ardith. 
- (DR:: 1575-05): The Chalice provides protection and healing for soldiers and refugees alike, and many hundreds of dwarves are rescued. 
- (DR:: 1575-08): The Chalice of the Runepriest sustains the refugees of Ardith and their rescuers on the long march south.
- (DR:: 1575-09-14): A fire giant, Odim Mavdyrson, attacks dwarven refugees from Ardith and the warrior mission sent to find them, on the Dunmari plains north of Tokra. The dwarves flee, constructing hasty fortifications around the Statue of the Stoneborn Warrior on the Dunmari plains
- (DR:: 1575-09-19): Odim Mavdyrson attacks the fortifications, breaking through. The leader of the dwarves, Hagrim Firebrand, turns on his companions as Odim approaches, creating the Shadowfell domain of [Morkalan](<../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/shadowfell/morkalan.md>) in death, and dragging the surviving dwarves to this realm with him. The chalice is abandoned in the fortifications surrounded the Statue of the Stoneborn Warrior. 
- (DR:: 1747-12-05) A group of Chardonian treasure hunters arrives at the ancient Statue of the Stoneborn Warrior and finds a major cache of Dwarven relics hidden nearby, including the Chalice of the Runepriest. Two of them -- Vita, an archer, and Caius, a skirmisher -- are pulled into [Morkalan](<../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/shadowfell/morkalan.md>).
- (DR:: 1747-12-15): The Chalice of the Runepriest passes through Songara, carried by Chardonian treasure hunters 
- (DR:: 1748-01-15): Rumors reach Riswynn Brawnanvil and other dwarves of [Nardith](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/nardith/nardith.md>) in the Yuvanti Mountains that treasure hunters are seeking ancient artifacts among the ruins of Ardith, including rumors that the Chalice of the Runepriest has been recovered.
- (DR:: 1748-02-04): The Chalice of the Runepriest arrives in Chardon
- (DR:: 1748-04-11): The Chalice of the Runepriest is purchased by Galen for his private study
- (DR:: 1748-08-23): Galen argrees to sell the Chalice of the Runepriest to Riswynn, a dwarf of Nardith
- (DR:: 1748-08-24): Riswynn purchases the Chalice of the Runepriest for 8000 gold pieces and a minor magic item, a Black Light Candle. Riswynn attempts to use the chalice to teleport [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) to safety, but is instead transported to the [Heart of the Mountain](<../../cosmology/multiverse/spiritual-realms/divine-realms/heart-of-the-mountain.md>)
- (DR:: 1748-08-25): Riswynn and companions [take the Chalice of the Runepriest into Morkalan](<../../campaigns/dunmari-frontier/session-notes/session-53-54-dufr.md>), where they use it destroy Hagrim and the shadowfell domain of [Morkalan](<../../cosmology/multiverse/echo-realms/shadowfell/morkalan.md>)
- (DR:: 1748-10-05): The Chalice of the Runepriest is returned to its rightful place in [Tharn Todor](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/nardith/tharn-todor.md>)
