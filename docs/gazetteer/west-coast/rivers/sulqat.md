The Sulqat is a cold, rushing river, mostly unnavigable, that flows northeast from the [~Mawakel Border Mountains~](<../mawakel-border-mountains.md>) to the [~Great Bay~](<../../../worldbuilding/tentative/great-bay.md>), past the city of [Suhaya](<../mawar-confederacy/suhaya.md>). The salmon runs on the Sulqat are a major source of food and income for the people of the [Mawar Confederacy](<../mawar-confederacy/mawar-confederacy.md>).
