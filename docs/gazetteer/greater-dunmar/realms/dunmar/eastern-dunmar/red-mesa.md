# The Red Mesa
<div class="grid cards ext-narrow-margin ext-one-column" markdown>
-    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A [Dunmari](<../dunmar.md>) holy site of [Shakun](<../../../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari/shakun.md>) in [Eastern Dunmar](<./eastern-dunmar.md>), [Dunmar](<../dunmar.md>), [Greater Dunmar](<../../../greater-dunmar.md>)  
</div>


The Red Mesa is a large, flat topped mesa of red stone, that rises six hundred feet or more above desert, marked by ochre rock formations that seem almost to pulse with inner life. 

According to the Shakun mystai, the mesa has been at this location since the early days of [Dunmar](<../dunmar.md>). They claim that the mesa is the physical representation of [Shakun](<../../../../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari/shakun.md>) herself, the mark of her presence on Taelgar.
