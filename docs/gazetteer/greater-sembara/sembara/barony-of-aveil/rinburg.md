    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A town in the [Barony of Aveil](<./barony-of-aveil.md>), [Sembara](<../sembara.md>), the [Western Green Sea Region](<../../../western-green-sea/western-green-sea-region.md>)  
</div>


A trading town at the head of navigation of the [Enst](<../../rivers/wistel-enst-watershed/enst.md>). A busy ferry crosses the river here, and it is the only place to cross the Enst until [Cleenseau](<cleenseau-region/cleenseau/cleenseau.md>), sixty miles further west. The landscape around Rinburg is pastoral fields and farms, and there is much good sheep pasture within two days ride. Rinburg is named for [Lake Rin](<./lake-rin.md>), a large lake just upriver, which is also a rich source of fish. Despite the river being navigtable downriver from Rinburg, here 

Rinburg is a free city, not under the control of any baron, and owes taxes and allegiance to the [Duchy of Wisford](<../heartlands/duchy-of-wisford.md>), rather than the [Barony of Aveil](<./barony-of-aveil.md>). The town hosts a bustling market as well as a robust ceramic industry and a productive timber industry.

The economic strength of Rinburg is derived from three areas:

* A thriving ceramics trade, particularly focused on jars and similar storage items
* A robust local industry in timber and masonry
* A center of trade with much of the [Barony of Aveil](<./barony-of-aveil.md>), primarily in leathers, grain, beef, and wool

There are three major guilds:

* the Ceramics Guild, which controls the manufacture and trade of ceramic goods, mostly for export downriver
* the Masons Guild, which controls the local building trade, as well as the timber industry
* the Mercantile Guild, which controls the local markets as well as the ferries and docks on the Enst

The most notable building in town is the large Temple of the Night Queen.
