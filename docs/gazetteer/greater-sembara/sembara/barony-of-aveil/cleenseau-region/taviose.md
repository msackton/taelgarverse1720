    :octicons-location-24:{ .lg .middle } A village in the [Manor of Cleenseau](<./manor-of-cleenseau.md>), the [Barony of Aveil](<../barony-of-aveil.md>), [Sembara](<../../sembara.md>), the [Western Green Sea Region](<../../../../western-green-sea/western-green-sea-region.md>)  
</div>


A small hamlet in the [Cleenseau Region](<./cleenseau-region.md>) on the edge of the [Cleenseau Wood](<./cleenseau-wood.md>), a mile and a half north of [Cleenseau](<cleenseau/cleenseau.md>) along a dirt track. The small hamlet is mostly woodcutters, charcoal makers, and pig farmers and is part of the manor of the Lord of Cleenseau. It consists of about a ten buildings, only one of which is notable: a large, two story stone building with three large oak trees carved on the lintel, the home to [Perrin Voclain](<../../../../../people/sembarans/perrin-voclain.md>).  It is said this was once holy to a *[kestavo](<../../../../../cosmology/religions/kestavo/kestavo.md>)* of the wood, who has long since departed.

There is a small shrine to the Wildling attached to Perrin's house, with several ancient oak trees, which mostly serves as a burial plot for the hamlet. Perrin tends to this shrine.
