# The Shakun Mystai

One of the [Dunmari Mystery Cults](<./dunmari-mystery-cults.md>), mystical organizations devoted to the [Dunmari gods](<../../cosmology/religions/five-siblings/five-siblings.md>). The [Shakun](<../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari/shakun.md>) Mystai, devoted to the goddess [Shakun](<../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari/shakun.md>), are based in the [Temple of Shakun](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/temple-of-shakun.md>) in the small village of [Karawa](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/karawa.md>) in [Eastern Dunmar](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/eastern-dunmar.md>). The temple in [Karawa](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/karawa.md>) supports a community of somewhat over 100 initiates, along with a few dozen initiates-in-training and 40 or more lay associates of the mystai. The mystai are known for creating healing powders from the stone of the [Red Mesa](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/red-mesa.md>), and for somehow misleading and waylaying those who attempt to cross the eastern borders of [Dunmar](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>) with evil intent.
