# The Shakun Mystai

One of the [Dunmari Mystery Cults](<./dunmari-mystery-cults.md>), mystical organizations devoted to the [Dunmari gods](<../../cosmology/religions/five-siblings/five-siblings.md>). The [Shakun](<../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari-pantheon/shakun.md>) Mystai, devoted to the goddess [Shakun](<../../cosmology/gods/incorporeal-gods/dunmari-pantheon/shakun.md>), are based in the [Temple of Shakun](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/temple-of-shakun.md>) in the small village of [Karawa](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/karawa.md>) in [Eastern Dunmar](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/eastern-dunmar.md>). The temple in [Karawa](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/karawa.md>) supports a community of somewhat over 100 initiates, along with a few dozen initiates-in-training and 40 or more lay associates of the mystai. The mystai are known for creating healing powders from the stone of the [Red Mesa](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/red-mesa.md>), and for somehow misleading and waylaying those who attempt to cross the eastern borders of [Dunmar](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/dunmar.md>) with evil intent. 


In April 1748, the Shakun mystai, along with the rest of [Karawa](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/karawa.md>) and [Eastern Dunmar](<../../gazetteer/greater-dunmar/realms/dunmar/eastern-dunmar/eastern-dunmar.md>), were attacked by rampaging gnolls during the Summer Gnoll Raids of 1748. More than a dozen mystai died in the attacks, and still, in November 1748, the mystai are diminished in strength and number. During this time, [Dunmar Fellowship](<../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md>) experienced the an abbreviated initiation rite of the Shakun Mystai, while later, after the return of [Heart of Shakun](<../../things/artifacts-of-power/heart-of-shakun.md>), [Kenzo](<../../people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/kenzo.md>) and Drikod experienced the full initiation rite
